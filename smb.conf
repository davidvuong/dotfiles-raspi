  # Prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.

  # Use separate log file for each machine that connects.

  # We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything

  # through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.

  # Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace

  # Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
  # values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
  # domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
  # directory domain controller".
  #
  # Most people will want "standalone sever" or "member server".

  # If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what

  # This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
  # password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
  # passdb is changed.

  # For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following

  # This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes

  # 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.

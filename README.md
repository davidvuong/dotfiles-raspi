# Dotfiles (Raspbian)

**Welcome to my Raspberry Pi dotfiles!**

This repository is a cut-down version of my Mac OS X dotfiles found [here](https://github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles). This was specifically made to setup a similar environment on my Raspberry Pi. It also utilises ZSH as the shell and VIM as the terminal editor.

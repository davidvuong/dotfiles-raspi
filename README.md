# Dotfiles (Raspbian)

**Welcome to my Raspberry Pi dotfiles!**

This repository is a cut-down version of my Mac OS X dotfiles found [here](https://github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles). This was specifically made to setup a similar environment on my Raspberry Pi (v4.1.13). It also utilises ZSH as the shell and VIM as the terminal editor.

## Download & Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:davidvuong/dotfiles-raspi.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles

sh ./install.sh
```

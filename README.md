# Dotfiles (Raspbian)

**Welcome to my Raspberry Pi dotfiles!**

This repository is a cut-down version of my Mac OS X dotfiles found [here](https://github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles). This was specifically made to setup a similar environment on my Raspberry Pi (v4.1.13). It also utilises ZSH as the shell and VIM as the terminal editor.

In addition to just being a dotfiles repo, it's also a place where I document most of what I learn along the way. You can find those [here](https://github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles-raspi/tree/master/docs) or as comments in config files.

## Getting Started

1. Download [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) and Raspbian from the RaspberryPI official website.
1. Clone the project from GitHub:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles-raspi.git ~/dotfiles
  cd ~/dotfiles
  ```
